## About Meta

Meta is a powerful and specialized utility designed for professionals and enthusiasts who need precise control over the hidden information embedded within their digital files. Every photo you take contains a wealth of EXIF data (shutter speed, aperture, GPS coordinates), and documents can hold IPTC/XMP data (author, copyright, keywords). This "data about data" is crucial for organization, copyright protection, and workflow automation. Meta provides a clean, intuitive interface to view, edit, and manage this information directly, offering capabilities far beyond what is available in built-in operating system previews or basic photo apps.

The application is indispensable for photographers, digital asset managers, and archivists. It allows you to batch-apply your copyright information to an entire photoshoot, geotag images after the fact, or add descriptive keywords to make your library searchable. For legal or archival purposes, it can be used to redact sensitive metadata (like GPS coordinates) before sharing files. By giving you direct access to this foundational layer of digital files, Meta becomes a critical tool for maintaining professional standards, protecting intellectual property, and creating highly organized, searchable collections of digital assets.
